# Sensor-Controlled-LED-Lights-
This is about controlling LED strips using sensors and Arduino UNO Board.
This project can be implemented on bedroom, staris, etc.

In This project the sensors are connected to the arduino board. Sensor Send data to arduino then arduino sends data to the led strips and buzzer.
Then according to the data given to LED strips they light up.

Components needed:
1. Arduino UNO board (you can use arduino nano as well)
2. Relay
3. IR Sensor
4. Buzzer
5. 5V DC Power Supply
6. WS2812B Pixel LED Strips
